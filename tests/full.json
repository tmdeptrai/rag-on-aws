    "input": "How does Agentic RAG differ from traditional RAG systems regarding workflow structure?",

  },
  {
    "input": "What is the primary function of the 'Reflection' pattern in agentic systems?",
    "expected_output": "Reflection enables agents to iteratively evaluate and refine their own outputs by critiquing them for correctness, style, and efficiency, and then incorporating this feedback into subsequent iterations.",

  },
  {
    "input": "How does 'Adaptive RAG' determine which retrieval strategy to use?",
    "expected_output": "Adaptive RAG uses a classifier to assess the complexity of a user's query. Based on this assessment, it routes the query to a no-retrieval path (for facts), a single-step retrieval (for simple questions), or multi-step retrieval (for complex reasoning).",

  },
  {
    "input": "How does the 'Evaluator-Optimizer' workflow pattern improve response quality?",
    "expected_output": "It generates an initial response and then uses an evaluation model to provide feedback. The generator uses this feedback to refine the response in a loop until it meets acceptance criteria.",
